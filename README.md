I’m transitioning into cybersecurity with a strong interest in how systems behave under pressure and sometimes...how to break them lol😜.

This GitHub is where I document hands-on lab work, experiments, and things I break (and fix) while learning security operations, networking, and defensive tooling.

Most of what’s here comes from practical labs. Windows, Linux, logging, detection, attack simulation, etc with notes on what worked, what didn’t, and what I learned along the way.

## Objective

The goal of this GitHub is to document my cybersecurity lab projects and learning process in a clear, practical way.

I use it to track how I set up environments, generate telemetry, test detections, and analyze results — mainly so I can improve, but also so others can see how I approach problems and think through security scenarios.
