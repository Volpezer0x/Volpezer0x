## 👋 Hello, I’m Michael

I’m transitioning into cybersecurity with a strong interest in **how systems behave under pressure**, and sometimes…how they break 😜

This GitHub is where I document **hands-on lab work, experiments, and troubleshooting** as I build skills in security operations, detection engineering, and defensive tooling.

Most of what you’ll find here comes from **practical labs**, not theory:
Windows and Linux environments, logging and telemetry, attack simulation, detection attempts, and notes on what worked, what didn’t, and why.

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this GitHub is to **document my cybersecurity learning journey in a clear, practical way**.

I use it to:
- design and build lab environments  
- generate and analyze security telemetry  
- test detection ideas and investigative workflows  
- document assumptions, failures, and fixes  

This helps me improve — and gives others insight into **how I approach problems and think through security scenarios**.
